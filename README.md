# Grimson-Stauffer
This code was written in response to Assignment 1, available at
http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~sumantra/courses/ml/assignment_1.html

It uses adaptive gaussian mixture model for background substraction. 
Literature for the algorithm is available at 
http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/vsam/Publications/stauffer_cvpr98_track.pdf

Unhappy with the implementation in python (https://github.com/vinaym815/Python-Grimson-Stauffer) 
I wrote this script in c++ for better performance.
